\
a quick game i made during roadtrip in a car to play with my brother.\
\
improved it and fixed the bugs later the next day and it is still < 13kb (g.js and index.html files)\
\
you can play the game here (resize the window to 175% for full screen): https://mpshmakov.github.io/ping-pong-13kb/ \
\
if you want to run it locally for some reason, i think you would need to run a local server to play this game
